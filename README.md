# ðŸ§  MNIST Digit Drawer & Classifier

This project allows you to draw digits with your mouse, processes them into a 28x28 grayscale image (like MNIST), and predicts the digit using a trained deep learning model.

## ðŸŽ¨ Features

- Freehand digit drawing on a virtual canvas
- Auto-resizes and normalizes your drawing
- Predicts digits using a Keras-trained model (`mnist_model.keras`)
- Visualizes both your digit and its prediction
- Simple OpenCV-based UI (no Tkinter required)
